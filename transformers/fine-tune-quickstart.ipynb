The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.

Two people cannot use them at the same time because they're too close together, and there is no divider.

Unfortunately, while the rest of us love baseball (or in the girl child's case, will tolerate it for snacks up to and including cotton candy), our dog isn't much of a fan. She just squirms and wants to jump on everyone. Being that she HATES being away from us though, we took her for the long drive East and snuck her into the hotel for the first night since we got in late. \\n\\nBright and early the next morning, I took her over to Wiggles and Wags so she could have a spa day. The woman working at the counter was very nice. Even when I made an obviously incorrect and rude comment about it smelling like the pound (it does not), she was courteous enough not to make it an issue. She put out dog up in a luxury 7'x5' stall and I was off. Quick and painless. She even took it upon herself to call my vet for vacination records since I forgot them.\\n\\nSome 30+ hours later, I returned for my dog. While she was excited to see me, she didnt' appear to be devastated as she usually does when I leave her for a bit. The groomer did a fantastic job trimming her hair and even put a little bandana and bows on her (I will attempt to upload pictures). All four girls who I spoke to in the time I was there were very nice. I couldn't be happier with this pet resort.</td>\n",

The staff was friendly. Everything was very tasty. The hashbrowns  were awesome, but got a little greasy/salty by the end. I liked the Rib Eye better than the Steak, but all was good.

Unfortunately, I've been here thrice so far and have yet to love it.  The menu looks good in theory, but the food and service are average in my opinion.  \\n\\nSure, $4ish for a dog is a bit on the high end, but if the ingredients make up for it, I'm fine with the price tag.  However, what I do think is a bit much is the fragment of romaine lettuce I received with my salmon fishfurter recently.  It wasn't even enough lettuce to roll up alongside the dog (if you're a weirdo who likes to wrap everything in lettuce like I do).  At 50 cents extra, it's not going to break the bank, I'm curious as to why I'm paying 50 more cents to forego the nice looking fresh bun for half a leaf of romaine - I just don't get it. My manfriend went for one of the poutines and was also pretty disappointed.  I say, stick to Kelly's for poutine, check out Franktuary downtown for a dog and stop by the L'Ville location for their bar.  Everybody wins.</td>\n",

We live in Las Vegas and enjoy trying all the great restaurants in town.\\n\\nWe started with the grilled romaine and upon first bite it was so sour that none of us could eat it.  The waiter noticed we weren't eating it and we advised that the dressing tasted sour. He brought out the grilled octopus, which was tough but had a good flavor.  Because of the sour taste in my mouth nothing really tasted good. The french onion soup was the best thing we ordered.\\n\\nThe porterhouse was tough, quite a bit of grizzle. Completely sub-standard for a top steak house.  The braised brisket was tasty, but way too much fat.  I understand brisket needs to be fatty for flavor but the chef should have trimmed some off before serving. The pudding served with it had no taste, not even sure what it was.\\n\\nThe sides were standard, nothing outstanding. Brussle sprouts were ok but cauliflower was under seasoned. The onion rings were touted as being the best in town, not.  They were greasy.\\n\\nI love dessert, we ordered the s'mores, they were ok.  Apple tartin was so tasteless we left the entire pie. Was not worth the calories. It was my son's birthday and they serve a mini cupcake as their dessert. Really, just say happy birthday.\\n\\nBefore I wrote a review I called a manager the next day to discuss my concerns.  She basically said all their food is made from scratch daily and is always consistent. She advised she would discuss with the chef our issues and get back to me.  She never returned my call. I feel like I was blown off. Locals keep these restaurants busy all year long, not just during convention season. I am shocked that Tom Colicchio would have this kind of management.

My downgrade comes for these reasons: 1 star knocked off for this absolutely horrendous parking lot, and the other knocked off for the facility, staff, and practice of Bikram itself. \\n\\nLet's start with the parking lot. It is possibly the worst parking lot in Henderson, with its millions of entryways and no stop/yield signs. Everyone has the right of way. As I was walking out to my car for the last time in this studio, there was a pretty serious crash. Solidified my feelings for this studio's location. \\n\\nNow onto the second downgrade--the facility and practice itself. When I initially rated this place 5 stars, it was the only hot yoga I knew. Now that my eyes have been opened to other types of hot yoga/Pilates, I can't remember why I came back to practice this militant yoga. (Oh now I remember--thanks a lot, Groupon.) I still definitely believe in the principles behind the heat, but the rest of the Bikram philosophy--pass. \\n\\nThere is zero room for modification in Bikram. My knee hurts, okay? I'm going to lay down the way I want to with my knee resting the way that feels good for me. I'm not big on rules, and Bikram certainly has a lot of them. If you try to modify the poses in a way that makes your body feel good, you will be pointed out and corrected. In vinyasa yoga, the teacher leads you through practice. In Bikram, you are commanded through practice. It's a big difference to someone who tries to work on herself personally and spiritually during yoga practice. \\n\\nNone of this is the fault of this particular studio, of course. This is just my larger complaint about Bikram in general. Also Bikram the person is a capitalist, misogynistic sexually assaulting pig and I can't support him anymore. \\n\\nBut back to specific complaints about this studio. The new flooring is way too hot--it's like asphalt in an already hot room. The changing rooms are too small, the showers are frequently out of shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and the front desk workers are often too busy talking amongst themselves to get you checked in. There also has been a huge staffing change as far as teachers go, rendering most of my previous review out of date. \\n\\nMaybe I'm being a bit too harsh on the studio, but for the most part over the course of this Groupon, I have felt anger when leaving the studio instead of the inner peace and lightness I'm used to in hot vinyasa. \\n\\nPros\\nFree week for your birthday\\nKelsea momentarily restored my belief in Bikram as a practice\\nStacey is super nice and even guided me through my first day back practicing when I nearly passed out\\n\\nCons\\nWell, you know.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Coming out of Men's Warehouse I was hungry and was drawn by the smell in the parking lot - looking around I noticed Waldo's BBQ and determined that was the place. I walked in and was promptly seated. I thought the deco was nice and the dining area large. It wasn't very busy at the time, but it was still noisy.  A couple of kids were in the restaurant banging their feet and screaming. I thought someone in the back just stuck the pig. \\n\\nLooking at the menu with the mason jar of sweet tea and a BBQ Baker (which is a baked potato topped with your choice of meat) The waitress brought out two plates with Mexican corn bread and took our order for tea. I thought could it be? Maybe this will finally be good BBQ in Arizona and replace what I lost in Atlanta. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on the side instead of on the sandwich was advertised. I went with the sampler - chicken, pork and beef.  We each chose the horsey potatoes (mashed potatoes with a hint or horseradish) as our side. I also got sweet potato fries with my dish. She asked if we would like an order of onion rings for $2 - and when the rings came out they were excellent. Okay, I am done with the highlights...\\n\\nThe sweet tea was descent, but not that sweet - and disappointing to me was the lack of refills. I don't know if they were not available or I was just not offered one, but either way my drink went empty. For the sampler I was envisioning maybe a piece of chicken, a small piece of beef and a small piece of pork. Instead it was a plate of pulled various meet. The BBQ sauce was served separately in a bowl that I had to spoon out and drizzle over the meat. The mashed potatoes were a little runny and did have a hint of horseradish, but were overall non-impressive.  The sweet potato fries appeared to be frozen. Maybe they weren't, but they were thin, had an odd appearance and no flavor at all. If someone blindfolded me and allowed me to eat it I wouldn't know it was sweet potato. \\n\\nThe server had limited personality. She tried to talk about the Super Bowl and how last year she worked by herself and it was slow, but that was about it. When she came back and asked if we needed a box, our answer of no appeared to disappoint her as we did have food left.  There were several dishes on the table, which she didn't remove. When she checked up on us and we ordered the warm pecan pie with the side of ice cream, she didn't remove dishes. Only when the dessert came out and she had no room to sit the plate down did she remove dishes - and then it was only enough to make space. The rest remained on the table.  The pie, by the way, was lukewarm at best - not warm enough to even melt the ice cream slightly.  Finally another woman wearing a staff shirt came back and cleared the dishes. \\n\\nAs we were finishing I noticed several people coming in - and looking around the place had filled up since we entered. She ran the credit card and brought the receipt back saying you guys better go before I get busy...Don't worry, I will get going. Leaving the restaurant I noticed the sign in the window that said \\\"Sorry, We're Open\\\" ... that makes two of us...\\n\\nThe hunt continues for good desert BBQ. This was not it.</td>\n",
