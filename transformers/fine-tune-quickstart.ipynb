The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

They were still open when I came but they wouldn't serve me saying they're close. \\n\\nOkay...\\n\\nNext time in town, I was craving hot soup and thought I'd give it one more try. This time, they were open! Oh, thank God.\\n\\nThe place was rather modern in decor -simple and clean. It looked new inside and older from outside. There was a mixture of people from various cultures. They say, if an ethnic place is filled with their own kind, it is a sure bet for authenticity. Can't tell with this one, as around me there were bunch of people who didn't know how to eat their pho or how to pronounce it. This guy next to me thought the bean sprout side plate was a free appetizer salad that came with the meal and was looking for dressing.\\n\\nAnyway.. I stopped reporting on my people watching and back to the food. The fried egg rolls were pretty good and they served it with pickled vegetables, which I really enjoyed. I ordered the big pho and the broth tasted good and clear. However, it wasn't the best one I had. It didn't come close to the second best either. I had a lot of noodle left but the meat was on the lighter side. They were gone before I ate half of my meal. I lost interest in the noodle without any meat left in the bowl.\\n \\nThey charged for hot tea but I must say the hot tea was nice. It was Jasmine, and quite strong and heavy muscatel. I loved it. I stayed longer even after I finished my meal to empty the tea pot.</td>\n",

We are really close and thought that we would have somewhere to eat and catch a brew without entering the traffic jam at Concord Mills.\\n\\nThe food here is hit or miss depending on what you order. The items I have tried so far; BBQ pork ribs (tender and meaty, but the dry rub made them taste burnt, the sauce was good), Baked beans (dried out and cold), and the Salmon (delicious), the Ruben (thought it was good not great), fish and chips (don't order this unless you like more breading than fish, I pulled my breading off), the Tilapia special (honestly I wouldn't have served it, about the size of an iPhone), the wings are terrible too, deep fried with lots of breading, but the sauce was pretty good.\\n\\nWhen I first visited the server was attentive and constantly checked on us to make sure things went well. The last two times (dinner)... took an extremely long time to great us. The food service was horrible, it took over 30 minutes to get anything to eat and our drinks were not refilled or even checked on, even the beer. The salads came with the meal, the balsamic dressing was the consistency of pudding. The food was cold but after the long wait we just ate it. The server never returned to ask if everything was alright and the manager spent the whole time talking with friends at a table right beside us. We noticed a lot fewer cars in the parking lot than usual and it was within 45 minutes of a football game on Sunday evening, curious. We both commented on it and said what a shame if they go out of business.\\n\\nI agree with the other comments about the loud music playing over the speakers  throughout the restaurant. We could not hear any of the football games or baseball playoffs. This is a sports bar right??? They need to change that ASAP! Temperature was \\\"north pole\\\" cold and it was a nice 75 outside. \\n\\nWhat's good about this place, and why do we keep going back? First, it's close to us and there are TV's EVERYWHERE in the restaurant, so no matter what angle you are sitting at, a TV will be in your line of sight. All sporting events were playing the night we went and we loved it! This is a great place to come to watch any game you want and to have drinks. There is a huge selection of beer and it is cold and the mixed drinks are great too. I am a beer drinker, and this is just what we needed near Concord Mills. Two points for TV and beer.</td>\n",

That said, the food was sorely lacking.\\n\\nTheir chips and salsa are supposedly \\\"award winning\\\".  In all fairness, the mild salsa was unique.  It had a wide range of ingredients in it and was  tasty.  The spicy salsa was indeed spicy but there was nothing about it to make it stand out from other Mexican restaurant salsas.  The chips were unusual.  Some had the consistency of a deep fried pie crust.  In other words, they were very flaky.  Yet others were like chips found in other restaurants.\\n\\nFor my drink, I ordered a frozen mango margarita with salt.  The mango flavoring was faint and there was very little salt on the glass.\\n\\nFor dinner, I had a combo plate --- one chile relleno and one chicken enchilada.    The dish came with refried beans and \\\"fideos\\\" (noodles with a meat sauce).  The chile relleno was the worst one I've ever had.  It held together very poorly.  For example, when I was less than halfway through it, I cut off a piece with my fork and out came the entire remaining chile!  What was left was the batter and the jack cheese!  The chicken enchilada was generous with the chicken portion but pretty forgettable.  The fideos were certainly a unique touch and pleasantly flavored.\\n\\nThe restaurant was very good when it came to accomodating those in our group who were vegetarians.  They were willing to substitute sides that had meat in them for a vegetable side dish.\\n\\nService was friendly, prompt and helpful---no complaints there.  That said, I certainly won't go back when I'm in AZ.  Without going into too much information, the whole meal left me with a bad case of indigestion.\\n\\nThere is certainly much, much better Mexican food to be had in the Phoenix area!</td>\n",

They have the best chips and salsa in the area, second only to Mango's (but that's 20 minutes away, vs La Fonda which is 5). I do find it annoying that they charge you extra if you want chips and salsa with your to-go order. Because of that I have only ordered to-go once, and will usually eat in the restaurant, even though I'm always by myself. I love crispy shredded beef tacos and so that's what I typically order here. They are quite good, but not even close to the best. I have to add their red sauce in a jar to the taco just to give it some more flavor. Still one of the better tacos I've had here in AZ, though. I'm from LA so I'm super picky about my Mexican food. I do recommend the tortilla soup here, it's pretty tasty! I like the oily broth based tortilla soup, not southwestern style, and this one it pretty authentic. I think they should add avocado to it though! Service has always been decent: attentive, quick, and polite. North Tempe/South Scottsdale doesn't boast much in terms of great Mexican food, and in my opinion, this is the best place in that area.</td>\n",

At 8:08pm I called the store to remind them to call upon arrival to make sure I know that they were there. At this time I was told that the the delivery driver had already left for my order. At 8:20pm, an hour later the delivery had not arrived and I called again. The person who answered was extremely rude and I hung up and called back requesting a manager who said he would check with the driver on the status of my pizza. At 8:32pm an hour and 12 minutes later the delivery driver arrived with the wrong order because they ran out of something that I ordered and never had the courtesy to let me know on the 3 calls that my order would not arrive as I had requested and paid for. I never was given a receipt to sign and was not able to ensure the driver was tipped. I hope I am not screwed out of my money.</td>\n",
